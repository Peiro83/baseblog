#Baseblog Kirby Theme

This theme is made to give you [a nice and clean start](http://sashtown.de/blog/what-baseblog-is) to create a blog with Kirby. It allows you to setup your posts and pages quickly, so you can customize it and just start blogging. Here are some built-in features of this theme:

- custom post types (texts, links and videos)
- (multiple) categories
- responsiveness
- search
- error page
- RSS feed for your articles
- pagination for the article overview
- static tweet button
- prearranged blueprints for [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel) usage

##Kirby?
[Kirby](http://getkirby.com) is a lightweight, flexible and file-based CMS made by [Bastian Allgeier](http://bastianallgeier.com). If you want to learn more about Kirby, visit the Kirby Website and check out the [docs](http://getkirby.com/docs)!

##How to install the theme
After [installing Kirby](http://getkirby.com/docs/getting-started) just remove the default `assets`, `content` and `site` folder and replace it with the downloaded ones from Baseblog. For optional interface usage you have to install the [Kirby Panel](https://github.com/bastianallgeier/kirbycms-panel/).
